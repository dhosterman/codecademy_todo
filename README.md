codecademy_todo
===============

This is a simple todo application written in a weekend for the CodeCademy coding challenge. 

The requirements were: build a simple to-do application to create, replace, update, and delete task items with user registration, authentication, and authorization.

A working demo can be found [here](http://shielded-brook-3527.herokuapp.com/todo/).
